## Semester's End
After a jam-packed semester, we have finally come to the end. ICS 314 has imbued me with much knowledge relating to the software engineering process. As there were many lessons to be learned, I will be focusing on the most important ones that I have taken away from this course: coding standards and agile project management.

## Coding Standards
Coding standards are a set of guidelines and best practices that dictate the style and organization of written code. These standards serve as a blueprint for developers to follow, ensuring that the codebase remains consistent, readable, and maintainable. 

In ICS 314, we were introduced to ESLint, a static code analysis tool that enforces JavaScript coding standards in our projects. ESLint checks our code for syntax errors, style violations, and other issues, helping us identify and fix problems early on. As it was built into the IDE I used, IntelliJ IDEA, I was able to work through issues as they arose, saving me time and effort in the long run. As a result, I was able to produce cleaner, more professional code that was easier to understand and work with. This not only benefited me but also my teammates for the final project, who could quickly grasp the codebase and contribute effectively. Coding standards will always have its place in the software engineering process, as it is a fundamental aspect of writing quality code.

## Agile Project Management
Agile project management is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes adaptability, collaboration, and incremental delivery. In ICS 314, we followed issue driven project management (IDPM), which required us to divide the project into smaller tasks or issues that could be completed in a short period of time, typically no longer than three days. Each issue was assigned to a single team member, who was responsible for implementing, testing, and documenting the changes. These issues were then organized into milestones, which each had their own due date and were represented by project boards. We organized our project boards on GitHub, which allowed us to assign issues and track our progress by creating time estimates for our coding and non-coding efforts. By following this methodology, we were able to work efficiently, stay on track, and deliver our project on time. Agile project management is a powerful tool that can help teams overcome challenges, adapt to change, and achieve success in their projects. This can also be applied to projects outside of software development, making it a valuable skill to have in any field.

## Conclusion
ICS 314 has been a valuable learning experience that has equipped me with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in software engineering. Coding standards and agile project management are two key lessons that I have taken away from this course, and I will continue to apply them in my future projects. I am excited to see where this journey takes me and look forward to the challenges and opportunities for growth that lie ahead.
