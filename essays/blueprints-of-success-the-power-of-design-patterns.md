### Building Blocks
Have you ever built a Lego set? If so, you are most likely familiar with the process: follow the instruction manual and assemble the pieces together. Sounds simple, right? Well, imagine building a large scale Lego set, perhaps one that comes with hundreds, if not thousands, of small pieces. It is possible to take caution and slowly work your way through the set, but what happens if you make mistakes that may go unnoticed? A single block misplaced by just one [stud](https://brickipedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stud#:~:text=Studs%20are%20small%2C%20cylindrical%20bumps,still%20bear%20the%20word%20LEGO), or a piece going missing, a crucial one even, could throw your entire build off. You would then have to backtrack and see where you went wrong. What could you have done to avoid this?

Lego pieces and design patterns share similarities that illustrate their roles as foundational elements.
