### Building Blocks
Have you ever built a Lego set? If so, you are most likely familiar with the process: follow the instruction manual and assemble the pieces together. Sounds simple, right? Well, imagine building a large scale Lego set, perhaps one that comes with hundreds, if not thousands, of small pieces. It is possible to take caution and slowly work your way through the set, but what happens if you make mistakes that may go unnoticed? A single block misplaced by just one [stud](https://brickipedia.fandom.com/wiki/Stud#:~:text=Studs%20are%20small%2C%20cylindrical%20bumps,still%20bear%20the%20word%20LEGO), or a piece going missing--a crucial one even--could throw your entire build off. You would then have to backtrack and see where you went wrong. What could you have done to avoid this?

Let's take a look at how Lego pieces and design patterns share similarities that illustrate their roles as foundational elements:
1. **Similarities**: Just as Lego sets consist of standardized pieces with specific shapes and sizes that fit together seamlessly, design patterns provide standardized solutions to recurring software design problems. This standardization ensures consistency and facilitates ease of use across different projects and teams.
2. **Modularity**: Lego sets encourage modular construction, allowing for the creation of complex structures by combining smaller components. Through design patterns, developers can break down complex systems into smaller, manageable units that can be easily reused and combined to build larger, more sophisticated applications.
3. Reusability: Lego bricks are designed to be reusable, allowing builders to dismantle and reconstruct their creations multiple times without losing their structural integrity. Similarly, design patterns promote code reusability by encapsulating common design solutions that can be applied across multiple projects.

So, to answer the question, there are different ways you could have approached the Lego build. The pieces could have been sorted by size, shape, or color--especially those that appear only once throughout the entire set. Alternatively, instead of placing the pieces into one single module, you could perhaps split the build into smaller modules. That way, you would not have to take apart the build to undo a mistake. Finally, make sure to double-check, or even triple-check, with the instruction manual. The documentation is there for a reason.
