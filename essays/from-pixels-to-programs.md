### Uncertainty to Clarity
The road getting here has been a long one, and it wasn't a smooth ride either. I actually first attended college in August of 2019, a few months after my high school graduation. I entered the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UH Manoa) as a Nursing major. However, halfway through my first semester, I felt that I didn't have the passion that the rest of my classmates had. Since I didn't enjoy it, I chose not to force myself through the major and decided to switch to Social Work, as I wanted to be in a field that focuses on helping others. Long story short: that also didn't work out. Eventually, I realized I needed to take a semester off from school to figure out what I truly wanted to pursue. In that time, I reflected on my consistent usage of computers and considered its potential. Computer Science was never my initial choice when I declared a major, but after some consideration, I decided to embrace the challenge. Thus, I continued my education at Leeward Community College (LCC), graduating with an Associate of Science in Information and Computer Science. I learned the basics of programming there, along with other useful skills that I can apply to my future career. Those two years quickly passed, but I am grateful for the knowledge I have gained to bring me to where I am today.

### Semester Pursuits
Now that I am back at UH Manoa, I am ready to take on this semester and the rest to come. I look forward to learning more about the realm of software engineering and acquiring the necessary skills to become a proficient developer. In regards to ICS 314, it is a change of pace that I will have to get used to. It has been challenging already, but I am confident that what I learn in this course will prepare me for the future. I'll be able to gain experience building different projects and in doing more collaborative group work. Besides web development, I hope to explore other areas such as UI/UX design and game development, as I am highly interested in those. I also want to join a club here at UH Manoa that will assist me in achieving my goals. I believe it would be a great way to build connections and to further foster my growth.

### Nurturing a Passion
At this point, you might be thinking: what *exactly* sparked my interest in computer science? Like many others, it all started with video games. When I was younger, I remember my mother introducing me to the Gameboy Advance SP. I spent much of my free time playing the original Pokemon Sapphire, and it still remains one of my favorite games today. I later transitioned from console to PC gaming, and it revealed a whole new world. There was a greater variety of games to choose from, and each one had enticing gameplay and mechanics that had me playing for hundreds of hours. The amount of creativity and freedom found in these games inspired me to create projects in a similar fashion. To align with my future aspirations, I hope to contribute to the development of a game, whether it be my own or a larger studio's. Additionally, my interest in web development strengthened when I observed how dynamic websites can become and the many implementations they have. One day, I would love to help small businesses create a website to increase their online exposure, or simply create a comprehensive site for a game I might be interested in. Time will tell, but I hope to find my place in this vast field.
