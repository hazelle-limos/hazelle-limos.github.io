Throughout my coding journey, I have programmed in Java, Python, and C/C++. My familiarity with these languages have provided a solid foundation on the fundamentals, but as I dive deeper into the world of software engineering, there is still much more to learn. Enter JavaScript: a simple and flexible language primarily rooted in web development. My first impression was that JavaScript would be similar to Java, but that assumption was mostly based on the name itself, and ultimately, I was proven wrong. Completing the exercises on freeCodeCamp was my first time interacting with the language, which served as a nice refresher on concepts I already know (arrays, functions, objects, etc.), and a quick way of learning JavaScript's functionalities and intricacies. I ended up spending more time on the latter half of the exercises, especially on the module featuring ECMAScript 6 (ES6). Although it will undoubtedly take time and effort to master JavaScript, incorporating it into my skill set will prove to be valuable in future endeavors.
