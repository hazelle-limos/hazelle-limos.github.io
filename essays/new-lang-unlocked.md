Throughout my coding journey, I have programmed in Java, Python, and C/C++. My familiarity with these languages have provided a solid foundation on the fundamentals, but as I dive deeper into the world of software engineering, there is still much more to learn. 

Enter JavaScript: a simple and versatile language primarily rooted in web development. My first impression was that JavaScript would be similar to Java, but the assumption was mostly based on the name itself, and ultimately, I was proven wrong. Completing the exercises on freeCodeCamp was my first time interacting with the language, which served as a nice refresher on concepts I already know (arrays, functions, objects, etc.) and a quick, condensed way of learning JavaScript's unique functionalities and intricacies. I ended up spending more time on the latter half of the exercises, especially on the module featuring ECMAScript 6 (ES6). Concepts such as arrow functions and destructuring were difficult for me to grasp, and I'm sure this won't be the last of it. Although it will undoubtedly take time and effort to master JavaScript, incorporating it into my skill set will prove to be valuable in future endeavors.

From a software engineering perspective, JavaScript could be considered a good and bad language, depending on your preferences and how you utilize its features. It seems like a language that developers either learn to hate or love, based on varying opinions I have read. I'm still in the early stages of learning JavaScript, so forming a knowledgeable opinion on the language is a task still in progress. Though, as someone new to the language, I find its simplicity and versatility to be welcoming, as it opens up much potential for developing projects.
