### I. Introduction
In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool across various domains. One of its mainstream usages would be through chatbots, such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). Give it a prompt, and it will perform most tasks you ask it to do.

AI has controversially made its way to the classroom. Students are asking AI to complete their homework assignments, whether it would be writing an essay, solving a math problem, or writing code. Why spend hours on schoolwork when you can complete it in a matter of minutes? AI is not perfect, however. It will sometimes confuse itself, spitting out an incorrect answer or explanation. The extent of what AI can accomplish is still limited, of course, but with how fast it has grown over the years, there is no doubt it can be improved. 

That being said, it has become a cause for concern for those interested in software engineering. Many talk about how it can replace developers in the field, lowering costs and streamlining the development process. Despite these opinions, I believe AI can be a beneficial tool when used properly. I will be going in-depth on my personal experiences with AI, specifically ChatGPT--how I have used it in ICS 314, along with its impact and applications outside the course.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

**1. Experience WODs e.g. E18**
<br>
I did not use AI for the experience WODs, as the solutions were provided by the professor's screencasts. I wanted to test my understanding of the material, so I did not rely on AI assistance while completing these WODs.

**2. In-class Practice WODs**
<br>
Similar to the last point, I limited my usage of AI during the in-class practice WODs. These were meant to prepare us for the graded WODs, so using AI while practicing would defeat the purpose.

**3. In-class WODs**
<br>
While I was able to complete about half the WODs without AI, I ended up using it when I was running out of time or was not exactly sure on how to write the code. For the earlier WODs, I had the right idea of how to implement the required functions, but I sometimes could not get it to work properly. I did not want to risk incompletion, so ChatGPT was my last resort and often came in clutch. For the later WODs, I actually did not find it helpful when it came to recreating website pages. I have used it to fix slight formatting issues, such as aligning content to a certain side, but it seemed to have difficulty in doing some of the WOD's prompt (at least in my experience).

**4. Essays**
<br>
I have used AI for my essays. Most of the time, I ask ChatGPT to generate titles. If I am facing writer's block, I ask it to write a sample essay and try to find inspiration from that. I often avoid copying and pasting a generated essay, since I should not be doing so anyway, and I find that it adds too much unnecessary language.

**5. Final project**
<br>
I have used AI in completing the final project. While my assigned tasks were not too difficult, I am still quite inexperienced with React and Meteor, so I had to research how to create certain functions and components. I often troubleshooted using ChatGPT, since I was getting errors I was unfamiliar with.

**6. Learning a concept / tutorial**
<br>
I have used AI to learn a concept when I need it in a pinch. Though, there are many resources available to me that I would rather use, such as the modules for ICS 314, YouTube, and other websites geared toward programming help.

**7. Answering a question in class or in Discord**
<br>
During class discussions, I never participated myself, but I did use ChatGPT to answer the question of the day to at least get an idea of what we were talking about. Other than that, it was not used much to answer questions in class or in Discord.

**8. Asking or answering a smart-question**
<br>
I did not find the need to ask a smart question, since most of my issues were solved by searching online through Google and consequently through StackOverflow. I also did not answer smart-questions asked by my peers, so AI was not used for this purpose either.

**9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”**
<br>
I have used AI to give a coding examples. Whenever I wanted to learn more about a new concept, some of the websites I viewed did not give a thorough explanation on their examples. I was left feeling confused, so I asked ChatGPT to give me an example I could understand better. It was especially helpful for the Underscore functions, as there were many variations I could have used for completing certain tasks.

**10. Explaining code**
<br>
Going off the previous point, ChatGPT sometimes gave me code that used functions I was completely unfamiliar with. I asked it to give a basic rundown of what it did and if I should be using that instead of what I had originally implemented. 

**11. Writing code**
<br>
I have used AI to write code, but I would only take the bits I needed to implement it in my own code. Oftentimes, if I took the entire block that ChatGPT came up with, it would give an error.

**12. Documenting code**
<br>
I have not thought about using AI to document my code and am not sure if I ever will. I have seen it comment on code that it provided me, but it seemed too simple to be of any use.

**13. Quality assurance**
<br>
As mentioned before, I have used ChatGPT to troubleshoot errors I have encountered. I would copy and paste what I have, and ChatGPT would give input on what I could change. ESLint also does a decent job at finding errors that I might have missed.

**14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above**
<br>
I have not used AI for other purposes that were not listed.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
After using AI multiple times throughout the semester, I would say that it has enhanced my learning. I do not rely on it completely, but I use it to supplement information I have learned from other sources. It is also quite accessible. I can ask AI for help early in the morning or late at night, and it would provide me the answers I am looking for. It has a large knowledge base to retrieve information from, so I can save time when it comes to learning material on the fly or troubleshooting any issues I might have.

### IV. Practical Applications:
Outside of ICS 314, I have come across instances of AI almost everywhere. There are many forms of AI-generated media online, such as images, videos, and music. Social media is run by algorithms that constantly fill your feed with what you are interested in. Smartphones come with virtual assistants that can help you perform tasks hands-free.

One example I came across recently and find interesting is the creation of portable AI assistants. Two names have come up: the [Humane AI Pin](https://humane.com/) and the [Rabbit R1](https://www.rabbit.tech/). It sounds a bit ridiculous at first, as these devices have already garnered mixed opinions shortly after being released. They also seem to do what smartphones can already do, such as browse the internet and access cellular features. In demonstration videos, the devices were asked to describe the environment in front of them, as they are both equipped with a camera. While it was not perfectly accurate, it was able to describe most of what it saw. I think that type of feature would be useful for someone who may be visually impaired. If companies focused on creating AI tools or devices that solved real world issues, it could be accepted by a wider demographic. 

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
Some obvious limitations are the inaccuracy in the information provided by AI and misunderstanding prompts. ChatGPT will sometimes go in circles when trying to help me, and I either have to restart the chat or give up on using it. Additionally, as a student, it can be easy to fall in the habit of relying on AI. It ultimately comes down to how we utilize AI--if we choose to use it as a tool, rather than an easy way out.

As for potential opportunities, AI could be trained to handle more complex code and issues. Furthermore, if AI was able to recognize your learning style, it could provide personalized lesson plans along with feedback that can help you understand concepts better.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
Traditional teaching methods in the context of software engineering education often involve lectures, textbooks, coding assignments, and projects. Some students may prefer self-teaching methods, while others prefer face-to-face interaction. I do not think AI will replace professors completely, but it can be difficult for students to stay engaged during lessons. Professors may not always be available for help either, or students may not have schedules that line up with theirs. With AI, you can receive help whenever you need it and have it explained in a way that makes most sense to you.

### VII. Future Considerations:
AI should be used to enhance learning beyond the classroom, as mentioned by my previous points. I also appreciate how this class was more open toward the use of AI and hope it does not become discouraged in the future. Of course, you cannot prevent a student from full-on cheating if they choose, but that will reflect in the work they output when AI is not available for use. 

AI seems unavoidable at this point, so as long as it continues to improve and is not abused by students or instructors, it can find its place in education.

### VIII. Conclusion:
Overall, AI has been more beneficial, rather than detrimental, to my learning. The transparency about AI in ICS 314 should be maintained, as students should be able to explore the tools that work best for them. I admit, I might have relied on it a bit more than I should have, but it taught me how to use it more consciously. AI is not perfect and remains controversial, but it does have potential to grow into something bigger.
