In my junior year of high school, my history teacher encouraged us to participate in National History Day, a contest focused on historical research projects. The theme for the 2018 contest was "Conflict and Compromise." My group chose to create a documentary centered around the Black Panther Party (BPP), an organization whose efforts were directed towards challenging police brutality against African Americans. We thought the BPP was an ideal group to conduct research on, as they can be perceived as controversial due to their methods. Despite their efforts to protect and actively engage with the community through initiatives such as free breakfast programs for school children, their combative and confrontational approach often overshadowed their social endeavors.

Creating a documentary was the best way to convey the message of the BPP, as we included several video clips and images that highlighted the aura of the organization and the tensions they faced. My group members worked together to create a script, and the three of us each voiced over a segment of the documentary. I worked alone in editing the documentary. I compiled the video clips and images in a sequence following our topics for each segment, adding additional text and quotes to support them. I included rolling credits for the usage of the video clips, images, and music at the end of the documentary.

I no longer have access to my high school Google account, so I won't be able to provide any original documents, such as project outlines. However, I am able to provide the documentary, which can be viewed here:
