### Easy Keno

This project was developed as our last assignment for ICS 211 at Leeward Community College. It simulates the gambling game Keno: players must first select their bet amount, then select 10 numbers that will be compared to a set of 10 randomly selected numbers. To win, the player's number must match at least one of the randomly selected numbers, and they will receive their corresponding payout.

The simple GUI was created using Swing. Players are able to interact with the clickable buttons and the dropdown menu. After ending the Keno game, the results are outputted to a separate text file that maintains its history.
